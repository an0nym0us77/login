        <p> Hello, I wanted to tell you this for a while now, please read this only if you’re alone and not occupied with any other thing. <br>
            I think I should not talk to you more often because I learnt from you that we should not get too involved in someone so that It will be easier for us to move on from the fact “that person cannot be mine”. <br> <br>
            I feel really good talking to you, I am happy to have you in my life, but I really feel different things now. I feel uneasy if I don’t talk to you. If you don’t reply to me for a long time I become really really sad and I don’t know why I feel like something is missing If I don’t talk to you. I have issues telling people things about me but with you it’s like second nature.I mean it comes instinctively when you’re the person listening to me.It was not like this before, I don’t know what changed. <br> <br>
            You’re the sweetest girl I have met (now don’t say gppppp bassss😂) and I have told you this like a thousand times before but that doesn’t change the fact. <br> <br>
            You remember I used to send you flowers while saying “bye” like you do, you send me one flower and I used to reply to you with ‘two’ which meant I flower you ‘too’ (hope you got the pun haha). You told me you like him. I was really sad that day and I stopped sending you flowers in chat from that day onwards.I wish I could’ve come into your life earlier. <br> <br>
            Tula asa vatat asel “ha asa ka boltoye”, but jashi mazyasathi tu important ahes na tasach mazya sathi mi pn important ahe. What I mean to say is I can’t go further without making this confession. I’ve to be honest with you,I think about you alot,All the time, actually, <br> <br>
            The problem is that I don’t know whether it’s love or just temporary affection but I know one thing for sure that I like you alot and do you feel the same by any chance?? <br> I don’t want to jeopardise our friendship. We understand each other and maybe if we give us a shot we might make this work...You’re one of the kindest people I know and I don’t want to hurt you, and if you don’t want this to happen it’s fine as Joey says “these are just feelings, they’ll go away.”
